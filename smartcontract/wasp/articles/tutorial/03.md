# Exploring IOTA Smart Contracts

Previous: [Tokens and the Value Tangle](02.md)

## Creating a chain. Core contacts
In a test we can deploy one or several chains, deploy smart contracts in it and invoke them. 

In the above example `TestTutorial1`, the statement `chain := env.NewChain(nil, "ex1")` 
creates and deploys a new chain `ex1` in the environment of the test. 
Several chain may be deployed on the test.  

Deploying a chain automatically means deployment of all 4 core smart contracts on it.
The core contracts are responsible for the vital functions of the chain and provide infrastructure 
for all other smart contracts:

- `root` [contract](root.md). 
Responsible for the initialization of the chain, maintains the global parameters 
and the registry of deployed contracts.
It also handles fees and performs other functions. 

- `accounts` [contract](accounts.md). 
Responsible for the on-chain ledger of accounts. 
The on-chain accounts contain colored tokens, which are controlled by smart 
contracts and addresses on the Value Tangle. 

- `blob` [contract](blob.md). 
Responsible for the immutable registry of binary objects of arbitrary size. 
One blob is a collection of named binary chunks of data. 
For example, a blob can be used to store a collections of _wasm_ binaries, needed to deploy _WebAssembly_ smart contracts. 
Each blob in the registry is referenced by its hash which is deterministically calculated from data. 

- `eventlog` [contract](eventlog.md). 
Keeps an immutable log of events in the chain. Each event is a message, a string, 
emitted by smart contracts with the `Event()` sandbox call. 
The events are published over the Wasp node publisher for consumption of outside subscribers. 
Each events is also immutably stored in the `eventlog` on the chain with the timestamp and id 
of the smart contract which emitted the event. 
Important events such as the deployment of a new smart contract or processing 
of a request are emitted as events by the chain's core. 

## Writing and compiling first Rust smart contract
In this section we will create a new smart contract. 
We will write its code in Rust then will use the `wasplib` [library](../../contracts/rust/wasmlib) and `wasm-pack` 
to compile it into WebAssembly (_wasm_) binary. 

Note that this tutorial is not a tutorial of the ISCP smart contract development environment: 
for that we will provide other tutorials. 
The only goal of these examples is an introduction to fundamental principles of ISCP smart contracts.

We assume you already have Rust and `wasm-pack` [installed](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/). 

We will be using the examples located in the `wasp repository` at 
[articles/tutorial/example-tutorial](example-tutorial) directory. 

The `example-totorial` smart contract is a simple smart contract which stores a string in its state upon request and allows to 
retrieve the stored string by calling a view. The smart contract also implements an entry point which allows the creator
of the smart contract instance to withdraw all iotas contained in the smart contract's account on the chain.

```rust
use wasmlib::*;

const PARAM_STRING: &str = "paramString";
const VAR_STRING: &str = "storedString";

#[no_mangle]
fn on_load() {
    // declare entry points of the smart contract
    let exports = ScExports::new();
    exports.add_call("storeString", store_string);
    exports.add_view("getString", get_string);
    exports.add_call("withdrawIota", withdraw_iota);
}

// storeString entry point stores a string provided as parameters
// in the state as a value of the key 'storedString'
// panics if parameter is not provided
fn store_string(ctx: &ScFuncContext) {
    // take parameter paramString
    let par = ctx.params().get_string(PARAM_STRING);
    // require parameter exists
    ctx.require(par.exists(), "string parameter not found");

    // store the string in "storedString" variable
    ctx.state().get_string(VAR_STRING).set_value(&par.value());
    // log the text
    let msg = "Message stored: ".to_string() + &par.value();
    ctx.log(&msg);
}

// getString view returns the string value of the key 'storedString'
// The call return result as a key/value dictionary.
// the returned value in the result is under key 'paramString'
fn get_string(ctx: &ScViewContext) {
    // take the stored string
    let s = ctx.state().get_string(VAR_STRING).value();
    // return the string value in the result dictionary
    ctx.results().get_string(PARAM_STRING).set_value(&s);
}

// withdraw_iota sends all iotas contained in the contract's account
// to the caller's L1 address.
// Panics of the caller is not an address
// Panics if the address is not the creator of the contract is the caller
// The caller will be address only if request is sent from the wallet on the L1, not a smart contract
fn withdraw_iota(ctx: &ScFuncContext) {
    let creator = ctx.contract_creator();
    let caller = ctx.caller();

    ctx.require(creator.equals(&caller), "not authorised");
    ctx.require(caller.is_address(), "caller must be an address");

    let bal = ctx.balances().balance(&ScColor::IOTA);
    if bal > 0 {
        ctx.transfer_to_address(&caller.address(), &ScTransfers::new(&ScColor::IOTA, bal))
    }
}
```
Running the `wasp-pack build` command will produce something like this:
```

```

The 30KB file `example_tutorial_bg.wasm` is the binary of the smart contract. We will be using it in further examples. 
The file contains everything needed to deploy the smart contract on a chain run by the Wasp network.
