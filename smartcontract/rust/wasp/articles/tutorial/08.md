# Exploring IOTA Smart Contracts

Previous: [Calling a view from the Solo environment](07.md)   

For general description of ISCP account system see [ISCP accounts. Controlling token balances](iscp_accounts.md).

## Sending and receiving tokens with the address
Multiple chains in ISCP adds another dimension to the ledger: smart contract can exchange assets between themselves
on different chains as well as with addresses on the Value Tangle, the `L1`. 
We will skip explaining the whole picture for time being and will concentrate on one specific use case.

Let's say we are a wallet, we have private key (the address) and some tokens on it. 
The use case is about sending tokens to and receiving from a smart contract on a chain.

Here we explore the concept of `on-chain account` or just `account`. 
On the Value Tangle ledger the private key is represented by the address (the hash of the public key). 
That address holds balances of colored tokens. Those tokens are "controlled" by the private key.

In ISCP we extend the concept of _address_ with the concept of `account`. `account` contains colored tokens just like 
and `address`.
The `account` is located on some chain and it is controlled by the same private key (an address). 
So, address can control token on the Value Tangle (`L1`) and on each of chains (`L2`).

The chain essentially is a custodian of the tokens deposited on it's `accounts`.

The following test demonstrates how a wallet can deposit tokens on chain account and then withdraw it back.

```go
func TestTutorial5(t *testing.T) {
	env := solo.New(t, false, false)
	chain := env.NewChain(nil, "ex5")

	// create wallet with 1337 iotas.
	// wallet has address and it is globally identified through
	// universal identifier: the agent ID
	userWallet := env.NewSignatureSchemeWithFunds()
	userAddress := userWallet.Address()
	userAgentID := coretypes.NewAgentIDFromAddress(userAddress)

	env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, balance.ColorIOTA, 1337) // 1337 on address
	chain.AssertAccountBalance(userAgentID, balance.ColorIOTA, 0)  // empty on-chain

	t.Logf("Address of the userWallet is: %s", userAddress)
	numIotas := env.GetAddressBalance(userAddress, balance.ColorIOTA)
	t.Logf("balance of the userWallet is: %d iota", numIotas)
	env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, balance.ColorIOTA, 1337)

	// send 42 iotas from wallet to own account on-chain, controlled by the same wallet
	req := solo.NewCallParams(accounts.Name, accounts.FuncDeposit).
		WithTransfer(balance.ColorIOTA, 42)
	_, err := chain.PostRequest(req, userWallet)
	require.NoError(t, err)

	// check address balance: must be 43 (!) iotas less
	env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, balance.ColorIOTA, 1337-43)
	// check the on-chain account. Must contain 43 (!) iotas
	chain.AssertAccountBalance(userAgentID, balance.ColorIOTA, 43)

	// withdraw back all iotas
	req = solo.NewCallParams(accounts.Name, accounts.FuncWithdrawToAddress)
	_, err = chain.PostRequest(req, userWallet)
	require.NoError(t, err)

	// we are back to initial situation: IOTA is fee-less!
	env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, balance.ColorIOTA, 1337)
	chain.AssertAccountBalance(userAgentID, balance.ColorIOTA, 0) // empty
}
```
The example above creates a chain, then creates a wallet with 1337 iotas and sends (deposits) 42 iotas
to the corresponding on-chain account by posting a `deposit` request to the `accounts` core contract on that chain. 
That account will contain 43 iotas (1 iota more for technical reasons which 
we skip here). The address on the Value Tangle will contain 43 iotas less, of course.

In the next step the same wallet (`userWallet`) will withdraw all 43 iotas back to the address by sending `withdraw`
request to the `accounts` contract on the same chain. 

If the same request would be posted from another user wallet (another private key), the `withdraw` request would fail.
Try it! Only owner of the address can move those funds from the on-chain account.
