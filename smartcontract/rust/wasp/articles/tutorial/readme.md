# Exploring IOTA Smart Contracts

## Purpose
The document is an introductory tutorial of the IOTA Smart Contract 
platform (ISCP) for developers. 

The level of the document is technical. The target audience is software engineers who want 
to understand ISCP and the direction it is taking, in order to develop their own dApps 
and/or contribute to the development of the ISCP and the Wasp node. 

The approach in this tutorial is to introduce to main concepts through writing
unit tests of example smart contracts. 
We use Go testing package codenamed [_Solo_](../../packages/solo/readme.md) in all examples of the tutorial.

The knowledge of Go programming and basics of Rust programming is a prerequisite.
